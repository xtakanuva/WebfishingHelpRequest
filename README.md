Issues dealt with right now.

### Description

Currently trying to update a vanilla shop with a new file of it. I already have the assets for the new items, I am having issues creating the new shop, placing said items inside, and showing said shop.

### New Files

Brew_vending_shop.tscn # To replace the current vending_shop.tscn

### Walkthrough my thought process:

# In res://Scenes/HUD/Shop/, there are a few main folders and files

/ShopButtons/
- shop_button.gd
- shop_button.tscn
- shop_button_old.gd

/ShopSetups/
- bait_shop.tscn  # not what i'm looking for
- boat_shop.tscn  # not what i'm looking for
- general_shop.tscn  # not what i'm looking for
- progression_shop.tscn  # not what i'm looking for
- sell_shop.tscn  # not what i'm looking for
- shop_category.gd
